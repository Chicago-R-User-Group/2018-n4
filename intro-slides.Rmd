## R/Finance 2018: June 1st-2nd at UIC {.smaller}

```{r, out.width = "900px"}
path <- paste0(getwd(), "/images/R-finance-header.PNG")
knitr::include_graphics(path)
```

From the inaugural conference in 2009, the annual R/Finance conference in Chicago has become the primary meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in Finance. Participants from academia and industry mingle for two days to exchange ideas about current research, best practices and applications.

The best part is, it takes place right in our backyard!
