# Getting Data into R

The html document is the one I used in my presentation. The fact that it goes in 'pages' that can be clicked thru is due to the type of document it is.  The .rmd file is the file that was used to create the html. Feel free to use it as a template, or as a 'what not to do' as you prefer. 

Joe didn't get (while I was there) to talk about RStudio, but one if it's great features is that it allows one to produce really nice documents without any real work.  Mine is a RMarkdown slidly presentation. Google it,but it is a point and click operation and new pages are created by putting (at least ) one blank line,--- (3 dashes) and (at least) one more blank line.  Have fun.
