# R from the Beginning: R Training Session

We'll start with some motivations on how and why R has developed and adapted to meet the needs of modern data analysis workflows spanning nearly every domain in science and business. We will then show you how to install R, RStudio, and give a variety of introductory examples of how to use R.

Bring your laptop, and we'll bring the wifi, power for your computer, and power for you with coffee, pop, and pizza courtesy of Microsoft's Developer Advocates. Thank you Dave Smith and Microsoft!
