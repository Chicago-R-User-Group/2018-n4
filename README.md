# R from the Beginning: R Training Session

We started with some motivations on how and why R was created and its continued evolution to meet the needs of modern data analysis workflows spanning nearly every domain in science and business. We then showed folks how to install R, RStudio, and gave a variety of introductory examples of how to use R.
